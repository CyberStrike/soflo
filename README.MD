### Testing

This app is a black magic box and we will treat it as such.
So only feature testing. Because why bother with anything else if the 
views aren't broken and the users can use the app successfully.

### Contributing
---
1. Pull Requests for features must have an issue and tests.
2. Pull Requests for bug fixes must have a corresponding issue.
3. If there are no corresponding issues create one.
4. If you have a feature and need assistance such as writing your test,
  or hit a roadblock assign the appropriate label to the issue.
